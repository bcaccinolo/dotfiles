2013-07-23 13:49:46	chase-work	alright this is getting silly. I have a gem I re-built. gem install works fine. putting it in the Gemfile and running bundle install works fine. Starting the console or the server works fine. But config. options in the environment file return no such file to load for that gem. nor can I seem to access it in the console. Any thoughts?

Now I'm going to have a go at putting the site live on my MediaTemple DV. Just wondering, is passanger a requirement? Like, you can't just use apache - rails apps have to have passenger to work?

2013-07-23 13:51:09	universa1	JoshuaPaling: no. rails apps need an app server for it to work.
2013-07-23 13:51:27	nikeita	universa1, my problem is the selection of product with thousand of it

2013-07-23 15:38:23	Mikail_	Hi, I have a fundamental question. I'm trying to include/require an external module with some classes in that in my project. Basically I collect login credentials in a form, and calls an external login method with those  towards a remote REST API - returning an object with the login info, cookie etc. I need this object to call various methods that I display in my pro?ject. So It needs to? be stored somewhere between models, ?controlle
2013-07-23 15:38:23	Mikail_	and various views. Is there some standard way to do this?

2013-07-23 16:20:37	mantas322	now im trying to go by the github example and use "require 'zip'
2013-07-23 16:21:02	juo100	mantas322: does you app have a Gemfile?
2013-07-23 16:21:11	universa1	IlyaLevin: look at config/envs/production.rb -- there is a ssection about that.
2013-07-23 16:21:13	mantas322	oh also I added "gem 'rubyzip"
2013-07-23 16:21:29	juo100	and ran "bundle install" ?
2013-07-23 16:21:29	mantas322	I did "gem install rubyzip"   on my app
2013-07-23 16:21:34	mantas322	wait!
2013-07-23 16:21:46	juo100	or just "bundle" should do the trick

I recently moved to rails 3.2 before that I was using 2.3. in 2.3 I used URI.escape but since in 3.2 everything is escaped automatically I removed it. But it seems it also escapes '&' characters.

2013-07-24 09:19:33	Radar	The problem I see is that you have ugly code in the view that could be improved by moving it to a helper.
2013-07-24 09:19:47	Radar	calling raw() on the output of that helper method would prevent anything from being escaped that shouldn't.

So can't use unshift and will have to use insert_before. Maybe I should request a documentation update for this…

I used "bundle outdated" to find out which of my gems need an update, but since Rails4 is available, it always shows an update from 3.2.13 to 4.0.0, not the Rails3 updates anymore. What is the best way to check which of my Rails3 gems are outdated?

2013-07-25 13:27:57	vikhyat	Sorry about that. I'm trying to figure out if it's a good idea to use the "fail_timeout 0" setting in the nginx configuration. As I understand it that is useful with Unicorn because unicorn kills worker processes if they take too long to return a response, but Puma doesn't have any timeout for requests. However a lot of the sample configurations I've seen online seem to include the "fail_timeout=0" setting.

2013-07-25 13:29:26	shrey	So, Rails 3.2.12 apparently depends on i18n  (~ 0.6). I'm facing a problem because formtastic (1.2.3) depends on i18n 0.4. Anyone faced this problem before? I'm unable to upgrade formtastic for now.

2013-07-25 18:41:11	jblack	Hello. I'm having a rough time figuring out how to handle gems right.  I'm  using mongoid (an ORM for mongodb), and I'd like to learn how to use action_controller. However, when I attempt to include that gem, I get "Unable to activate actionpack-4.0.0, because activesupport-3.2.14 conflicts with activesupport (= 4.0.0), builder-3.0.4 conflicts with builder (~> 3.1.0) (Gem::LoadError)".

2013-07-25 18:41:18	jblack	How does one deal with this normally? I tried making a Gemfile that has "Unable to activate actionpack-4.0.0, because activesupport-3.2.14 conflicts with activesupport (= 4.0.0), builder-3.0.4 conflicts with builder (~> 3.1.0) (Gem::LoadError)", because I think action_controller is within there, but I still get the error

2013-07-25 18:42:58	Syrit	In my app, i would like to populate a select tag (dropdown list) , with a record from the Database, what comes to my mind first is, creating a method inside the model to query the db, and then calling it in the view, is that the correct way to do so ?
2013-07-25 18:43:00	tubbo	jblack: also why just action_controller? what's wrong with action_pack and the rest of the rails stack? :)

2013-07-26 12:13:49	helpa	Hi RoRdavid. We in #rubyonrails would really appreciate it if you did not use pastebin during your time with us.
2013-07-26 12:13:49	helpa	Pastebin is not good because it loads slowly for most, has ads which are distracting and has terrible formatting. Please use Gist (http://gist.github.com) or Pastie (http://pastie.org) instead. Thanks!
2013-07-26 12:13:52	Cool_	<dopie> did you get the solution
2013-07-26 12:14:50	rushed	RoRdavid: wow, back up a step, what are you trying to do :)
2013-07-26 12:14:55	maasha	universa1: so you suggest that all should should be replaced with expect?
2013-07-26 12:15:25	universa1	maasha: no, i suggest that you fix your wrong uses of expect first
