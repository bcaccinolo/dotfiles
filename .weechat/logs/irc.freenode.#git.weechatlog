2013-07-24 09:07:28	SamB	shwouchk: I really don't think it is, unless you also need test data for an implementation of git
2013-07-24 09:07:48	shwouchk	iveqy: I want to use a single git repository the way I use dropbox (aside from needing to commit).
2013-07-24 09:08:29	shwouchk	SamB: you are mistaken. I want it, hence I need it. There needs not be a further reason.
2013-07-24 09:09:07	iveqy	shwouchk: then you best chance is to add some pre-commit and post-checkout hooks that will zip our inside git repos before commiting

2013-07-24 09:10:21	@gitinfo	Storing git repositories on DropBox is a Very Bad Idea™. Use a free hosting service (such as Bitbucket or GitHub), or read !dropbox_why if you insist upon having your repo corrupted.

2013-07-24 09:10:46	iveqy	an other alternative would be to use sshfs and maybe rsync-backup (if you need incremental backups)

2013-07-24 09:13:04	iveqy	or are you only going to use git to versioning your home tree locally?

2013-07-24 11:24:47	cbreak-work	I didn't

2013-07-24 11:29:29	cbreak-work	no...

2013-07-24 11:37:07	mastro	cbreak-work, nowhere in git help tag I see the doc saying annotated tags are meant for release and lightweight for tagging random thing....
2013-07-24 11:37:14	cbreak-work	OwiecPL1986: also, you might not be allowed to install any hooks on bitbucket
2013-07-24 11:37:21	cbreak-work	so you can't make automation happen that way
2013-07-24 11:37:36	OwiecPL1986	but only for develop version, i want on serwer always the newest veriosn for testing
2013-07-24 11:37:37	cbreak-work	mastro: they aren't meant for that. They are used for that.
2013-07-24 11:37:40	mastro	cbreak-work, also you make a distinction between the two but "git tag" show both of them and there is no option to show only annotated tag or lightweight tags

2013-07-24 11:41:50	mastro	cbreak-work, suppose you are a new git user, you don't know anything about git and you are learning it. You want to create a tag.
2013-07-24 11:42:49	mastro	cbreak-work, you read git help tag and find out there are annotated tags and lightweight tag. You may choose (like I did) to use -a for some tag and don't use it for others because it seems -a is just useful when you have something to say about that tag

2013-07-24 12:20:39	OwiecPL1986	is it possible to push directrly form my computer to server? When i want finish new develop version i want push that to bitbucket and also to develop server. But is it possible to push directly to working directory on server /hoem/user/www/public by sftp?

2013-07-24 12:21:06	@gitinfo	OwiecPL1986: Git is not a deployment tool, but you can build one around it(in simple environments) or use it as an object store(for complex ones). Here are some options/ideas to get you started: http://gitolite.com/the-list-and-irc/deploy.html
2013-07-24 12:22:33	Latro	Iveqy: Correct. At the moment, I am reading the tutorial of this page http://git-scm.com/book/es
2013-07-24 12:22:41	iveqy	OwiecPL1986: short answer; no. a little longer answer; yes but you will eventually really screw up. The correct answer; it works perfectly fine if you use the right technics and read the docs I pointed you to
2013-07-24 12:23:03	OwiecPL1986	iveqy but this is for situation when hub is on the same server as production?
2013-07-24 12:23:39	iveqy	decci: I would appriciate if you try to explain to me. Because to me it sounds really stupid (however, much things seems really stupid when you don't have the whole picture)
2013-07-24 12:24:18	iveqy	Latro: okay, good luck. You will be easier off if you're able to use english, most documentation and all commands is in english
2013-07-24 12:24:39	iveqy	OwiecPL1986: what's hub?
2013-07-24 12:25:20	iveqy	OwiecPL1986: and you're still talking about a push, doesn't matter if it's to a local server or a remote server, it will still be threated as a remote git repository
2013-07-24 12:25:21	Latro	but I will have questions later (sure)

2013-07-24 14:12:59	cbreak-work	alexander__b: you have to make the sample pre-commit hook executable and give it the correct name

2013-07-24 14:27:32	shwaiil	how to delete a commit from remote repository ? I've made some changes and did git add -u instead of just add the changes I wanted then pushed git push origin branchX. I undo locally but I need to do the same in the repo, is there a way to delete that commit ?!

2013-07-24 14:27:52	alexander__b	Arafangion: sadly I do not have enough time because it's a super short project, and interns and blah. but in srs projects I of course just reject that crap.
2013-07-24 14:28:07	iveqy	alexander__b: git has some tools for helping with lineending conversion (as you've already beeing told) however I find it really creepy to have a SCM altering my files. That's what I've an editor for.
2013-07-24 14:28:11	alexander__b	!force
2013-07-24 14:28:11	@gitinfo	[!force_push] If you need to overwrite the history of a remote git repository (very bad idea, see !rewrite), you can do so with `git push -f`.  Note the remote server may reject this.  See man git-config and search for receive.denyNonFastForwards.  Best practice is for upstream servers to denyNonFastForwards.
2013-07-24 14:28:20	iveqy	shwaiil: !public
2013-07-24 14:28:20	@gitinfo	shwaiil: [!rewriting_public_history] Rewriting public history is usually bad. Everyone who has pulled the old history have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to). If you must, you can use `git push -f` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum

2013-07-25 15:31:36	iveqy	wasanzy: the short answer is, yes you can created git repositories inside git repositories if you make a few hacks not to trick git that it has multiple .git-dirs. However it will be really stupid to do, since you most likely  will have hard binary merges ahead of you
2013-07-25 15:32:35	iveqy	wasanzy: you probably want to use submodules, subtrees or just don't use git at all (since many people that ask this question tries to use git as a backup-utility or something other that git doesn't is)

2013-07-25 16:00:41	tang^	drizzd: yeah. though part of that was my fault. I merged my local branch into master and pushed it and his report caught only three of the ten commits that got pushed
2013-07-25 16:00:56	ruckerz	i have a 'forked' github repo which has its upstream set to the parent, thus i have my own 'master', and my own branch 'a'. I update master with `git fetch upstream/master` and `git merge upstream/master` , now i try to ` git push origin` (to update my origin with what I pulled from upstream/master) and my local branch 'a' rejects my push… `git pull origin a` leads to many conflicts during an auto merge… suggestions?

2013-07-25 16:33:37	SliMM	in what context would std::vector<std::vector<double>> be much (two times) slower than double**?
2013-07-25 16:34:00	SliMM	because I was under the impression that the generated code is the same
2013-07-25 16:34:36	jast	a vector is a managed data structure, i.e. its size can change

2013-07-25 18:44:53	@gitinfo	ufk: That's a rather ambiguous question... options: a) make a commit that "undoes" the effects of an earlier commit [man git-revert]; b) discard uncommitted changes in the working tree [git reset --hard]; c) undo committing [git reset --soft HEAD^]; d) restore staged versions of files [git checkout -p]; e) move the current branch to a different point(possibly losing commits)[git reset --hard $COMMIT]?

2013-07-25 18:45:30	doorp	Let me ask it differently, I would like to 'checkout' a specific commit via its hash, I use "git checkout <hash>" ... but it seems that sometimes the state of the stage has an impact of the checkout'd stage? Is there something more I should do than "git checkout <hash>"?
2013-07-25 18:45:52	ufk	git reset HEAD dir
2013-07-25 18:45:58	ufk	that's what i did.. is that ok ? :)

2013-07-25 18:47:29	@gitinfo	doorp: Please paste (using https://gist.github.com/ or similar) a transcript (https://gist.github.com/2415442) of your terminal session -- or, even better for complex issues, design a minimal case in which your problem can be reproduced, and share it with us. This will help immensely with troubleshooting.
2013-07-25 18:47:30	osse	ufk: also not that 'git status' will tell you how in case you forget it again

The topic has links with more information about git and this channel. NB. it can't hurt to do a backup (type !backup for help) before trying things out, especially if they involve dangerous keywords such as --hard, clean, --force/-f, rm and so on.
